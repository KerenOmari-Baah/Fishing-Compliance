## Fishing Activity Analysis using AIS Data

This project utilizes Python and Jupyter Notebook to analyze Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for identifying and describing fishing behaviors, detecting pair-trawling activities, and assessing the effectiveness of closed season periods in maritime regions, particularly focusing on Ghana's waters.

### Data

The AIS dataset includes information such as vessel identity, type, position, speed, and navigational status. 


### Analysis Overview

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and formated the AIS CSV data for analysis using Pandas.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examined and visualized the data using matplotlib and numpy to understand vessel movements and identify potential fishing activity.
3. **Behavior Analysis**: Analyzed the vessel movements to identify different fishing behaviors, focusing on methods such as pair-trawling.
4. **Closed Season Analysis**: Evaluated the impact of closed fishing seasons on activity by comparing data from different time frames using the datetime package.
